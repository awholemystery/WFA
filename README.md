# WFA (We Fuck All) selfbot.
Probably one of the best things that the humanity has ever done (lmao).

More seriously, this is the source code of every versions of KSCH's selfbot (include wfa-core), but you can have more informations about it with the "wfa-core-for-v4" branch. 

# Why?
Some people like Punchnox, a discord user, has already proven that the selfbot contain some malicious code (such as token grabber, to literally grab your Discord token to hack you), and I wanted to publish it so that you can see how it works.

# DISCLAIMER
1. Discord selfbots are forbidden by the Terms of Service of Discord and they are tracking down more and more detections of some selfbots, so use it at your own risk (if you want to use it).
2. The code is published for **educational purposes**, and not for any kind of spreading malware reasons[^1]. In other terms, __don't use it as malware to hack someone, it is prohibited.__

[^1]: Except for the wfa-core file, none of these selfbots have the token grabber in it because I've deleted them.
